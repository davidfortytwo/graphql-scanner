# graphql-scanner

## Description

`scan.py` is a Python script that checks a GraphQL endpoint for common vulnerabilities, including introspection, schema misconfigurations, and denial-of-service (DoS)-related issues. It is designed for **educational and authorized security testing only**.

This scanner supports:

    - ‚úÖ **Safe mode** to avoid DoS risks
    - üí§ **Request throttling**
    - üóÇÔ∏è **Automatic report generation** (timestamped `.txt` file)
    - üîê **Support for session cookies and Bearer tokens**
    - üß† **Schema analysis with field classification and depth estimation**
    - üö® **Sensitive field detection and live data resolution**
    - üìä **Schema coverage report with field/complexity metrics**
    - üí¨ **Verbose mode for debugging responses and headers**

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer**: This tool must only be used against systems for which you have **explicit permission**. Unauthorized use is strictly prohibited and may be illegal. Always respect target system policies, and follow responsible disclosure guidelines.

## Current Checks

- ‚úÖ **Introspection Exposure** (`__schema`)
- ‚úÖ **Circular Introspection Abuse** (`__type(name: "Query")`)
- ‚úÖ **Deeply Nested Query Handling** *(optional, skipped in `--safe-mode`)*
- ‚úÖ **Batch Query Processing** *(optional, skipped in `--safe-mode`)*
- ‚úÖ **Excessive Resource Exposure** (`__type(name: "User")`) with:
  - Field type classification (SCALAR, LIST, OBJECT, etc.)
  - Sensitive field heuristics (`token`, `password`, etc.)
  - Depth estimation
- ‚úÖ **Unlimited Directives Enumeration**
- ‚úÖ **Error-Based Enumeration** (e.g., "Did you mean")
- ‚úÖ **Authorization Bypass Detection** (with auth context awareness)
- ‚úÖ **Field Suggestion Leakage**
- ‚úÖ **Rate Limiting Behavior Test** *(optional, skipped in `--safe-mode`)*
- ‚úÖ **Fake/Hidden Type Discovery** (e.g., `Token`, `Session`, `SecretUser`)
- ‚úÖ **Sensitive Field Resolver** ‚Äî tests if sensitive fields return real data
- ‚úÖ **Schema Coverage Summary** ‚Äî field count, depth, exposure

# Installation 

Clone repository with:

    git clone https://github.com/davidfortytwo/graphql-scanner

Install dependencies with:

    pip3 install -r requirements

# Usage

Basic scan:

    python scan.py -t http://example.com/graphql

This will run the scanner against the specified endpoint and print out any vulnerabilities that it finds.

Optional Flags:

    Option	Description
    --safe-mode	Avoids checks that could cause server stress (deep nesting, batch, rate limit tests).
    --throttle <sec>	Set delay (in seconds) between each request. Default is 0.5.
    --verbose	Enables debug output, useful for troubleshooting.
    --cookie "<val>"	Include a session cookie (e.g., 'sessionid=abc123; other=value')
    --bearer <token>	Set a Bearer token for Authorization header

Example:

Run a safe-mode scan with a throttle and debug output:

    python3 scan.py -t http://example.com/graphql --safe-mode --throttle 1.0 --verbose

Run authenticated with a session cookie:

    python scan.py -t https://example.com/graphql --cookie "sessionid=abc123"

Run with a Bearer token:

    python scan.py -t https://example.com/graphql --bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...



# Output

All output is shown in the terminal with color coding.
A full report is saved to a file: graphql_scan_report_<timestamp>.txt.

Color Coding:

    üî¥ Red	Confirmed vulnerability or sensitive result
    üü¢ Green	No issue / resolved / blocked
    üîµ Blue	Informational or warning
    ‚ö™ White	Evidence, data dump, or debug info
    üü† Orange	(Planned for future use ‚Äî Medium/Caution)


Severity Levels:

    Info (Green)
    Low (Blue)
    Medium (Orange)
    High (Red)
    Critical (Violet ‚Äì reserved for future additions)
