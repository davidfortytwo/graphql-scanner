# graphql-scanner

## Description

`scan.py` is a Python script that checks a GraphQL endpoint for common vulnerabilities, including introspection, schema misconfigurations, and denial-of-service (DoS)-related issues. It is designed for **educational and authorized security testing only**.

This scanner supports **safe-mode**, **request throttling**, **verbose debug logging**, and generates a **timestamped report file** for offline analysis.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer**: This tool must only be used against systems for which you have **explicit permission**. Unauthorized use is strictly prohibited and may be illegal. Always respect target system policies, and follow responsible disclosure guidelines.

## Current Checks

- ‚úÖ Introspection
- ‚úÖ Circular Introspection
- ‚úÖ Deeply Nested Query (optional, skipped in `--safe-mode`)
- ‚úÖ Batch Requests (optional, skipped in `--safe-mode`)
- ‚úÖ Excessive Resource Requests
- ‚úÖ Unlimited Number of Directives
- ‚úÖ Error-Based Enumeration (e.g., suggestion leakage)
- ‚úÖ Authorization Bypass (type-level)
- ‚úÖ Field Suggestion Leakage
- ‚úÖ Rate Limiting Test (optional, skipped in `--safe-mode`)
- ‚úÖ Fake Type Discovery (e.g., `Token`, `Session`, `SecretUser`)
- ‚úÖ Sensitive Field Leak (e.g., `token`, `password` in `User` type)

## Installation

Clone the repository:


    git clone https://github.com/davidfortytwo/graphql-scanner
    cd graphql-scanner


# Installation 

Clone repository with:

    git clone https://github.com/davidfortytwo/graphql-scanner

Install dependencies with:

    pip3 install -r requirements

# Usage

Basic scan:

    python scan.py -t http://example.com/graphql

This will run the scanner against the specified endpoint and print out any vulnerabilities that it finds.

Optional Flags:

    Option	Description
    --safe-mode	Avoids checks that could cause server stress (deep nesting, batch, rate limit tests).
    --throttle <sec>	Set delay (in seconds) between each request. Default is 0.5.
    --verbose	Enables debug output, useful for troubleshooting.

Example:

    python3 scan.py -t http://example.com/graphql --safe-mode --throttle 1.0 --verbose

# Output

All output is shown in the terminal with color coding.
A full report is saved to a file: graphql_scan_report_<timestamp>.txt.

Color Coding:

Color	Meaning

    üî¥ Red	High/critical issue or clear misconfiguration
    üü¢ Green	No vulnerability found
    üîµ Blue	Informational or low severity
    ‚ö™ White	Evidence, data dumps, verbose messages

Severity Levels:

    Info (Green)
    Low (Blue)
    Medium (Orange)
    High (Red)
    Critical (Violet ‚Äì reserved for future additions)
